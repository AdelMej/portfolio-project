Front-end (Svelte)

The web application communicates with the backend API using secure HTTPS requests. It allows users to browse sessions, register, and perform payments.

Backend API (FastAPI)

This is the core of the application. It handles the main business logic through two modules:

Auth, Session and Registration → manages user authentication, sessions, and user registrations.

Session Management → handles session creation, availability, and attendance validation.

Database (PostgreSQL & NoSQL)

PostgreSQL stores structured data such as users, sessions, registrations, and payment status.
The NoSQL database is used for logs and activity tracking.
Only the backend API accesses the databases.

Stripe (Payments)

Stripe is used as an external payment service. The backend sends payment requests to Stripe, and Stripe sends webhooks back to the API to confirm payment results.
