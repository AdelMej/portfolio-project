SCM & QA Strategy

5.1 Source Control Management (SCM)
Git is used for version control to manage the project codebase and collaboration.

Branching strategy:

main → contains stable, production-ready code.
development → integration branch where validated features are merged.
feature branches → each new feature or fix is developed in a separate branch.

Before merging into the development or main branch, the code is reviewed to ensure correctness and consistency.
Regular commits are encouraged to keep track of changes and facilitate collaboration.

5.2 QA (Quality Assurance)
The objective of quality assurance is to ensure that the application is reliable, secure, and easy to maintain.

Testing strategy:

Unit tests → test individual backend functions and logic.
API tests → verify FastAPI endpoints such as authentication, session creation, and registration.
Manual tests → validate critical user flows such as registration, session enrollment, and payment.

Tools used:
Pytest → automated testing for FastAPI backend.
Postman → manual testing of API endpoints.
Ruff → maintain clean and consistent backend code (Python / FastAPI).

5.3 Deployment Pipeline

Development → local environment for coding and quick testing.
Staging → testing environment with a real database and Stripe test keys.
Production → final deployment with real users and real payments (planned for a later phase).
